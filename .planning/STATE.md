# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-16)

**Core value:** Every concept students encounter must be immediately intuitive — if a student leaves a workshop confused about what just happened, the materials failed.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Curriculum Foundation + Demo Infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Curriculum Foundation + Demo Infrastructure)
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase
Status: All plans complete — awaiting verification
Last activity: 2026-02-16 — Completed 01-03-PLAN.md (LLM Streaming Infrastructure)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 17%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 8 min
- Total execution time: 0.4 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 3/3 | 25 min | 8 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (5 min), 01-02 (5 min), 01-03 (15 min)
- Trend: Consistent

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Timeline: Cohort 2 starts this week — iterative delivery workshop by workshop
- Demo stack: Same React/Vite/Tailwind app for consistency with existing demos
- Quality approach: Establish baseline standards for ALL workshops before polishing any single one
- Curriculum: Learning objectives derived from actual notebook content, not PLAN.md descriptions
- Curriculum: Workshop 2 notebook covers prompt engineering + code generation loop (not just LLM basics)
- Curriculum: Time allocations follow ~10-12 min demo, ~38-40 min notebook, ~10 min Q&A for teaching workshops
- Demo infra: Hash-based routing for zero-dependency simplicity in demo shell
- Demo infra: DemoRegistry pattern for adding demos (component file + registry entry)
- Demo infra: Tailwind v3 (not v4) to match established scratchpad theme
- Streaming: Fetch-based SSE for OpenAI API (no openai npm package) — lightweight bundle
- Streaming: useStreamingText hook as unified API for all demo streaming
- Streaming: Hidden "live" keyboard toggle approved for instructor-only features

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Timeline urgency:** Workshop 2 materials needed THIS WEEK (Cohort 2 starts). Phase 1 must complete quickly to enable Phase 2 delivery.

**Demo complexity risk:** New demos (tool use, memory, code sandbox) are hypothesized to produce "aha moments" but not student-tested. Each demo needs clear one-sentence "aha moment" defined before building.
