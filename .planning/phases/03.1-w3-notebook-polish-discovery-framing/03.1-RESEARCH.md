# Phase 3.1: W3 Notebook Polish: Discovery Framing - Research

**Researched:** 2026-02-24
**Domain:** Pedagogical framing, discovery-driven notebook narrative design
**Confidence:** HIGH

## Summary

This phase restores the "What if..." discovery arc to the Workshop 3 notebook. The current notebook has correct content, scenario (restaurants), agent v1-v4 progression, and code -- but its framing is declarative ("What LLMs Can and Cannot Do") rather than discovery-driven ("Let's see if..."). The original notebook (commit 4ef0ef5) had a strong pedagogical voice where students experienced frustration and surprise before conclusions were revealed. This phase brings that voice back without changing any content, code, or scenario.

The research below provides a cell-by-cell audit comparing the current notebook against the original's discovery patterns, identifies which cells need full rewrites vs. light touch vs. no change, and recommends specific narrative patterns for the planner to use.

**Primary recommendation:** Focus edits on ~15 markdown cells (intro, Part headers, Key Insights, and transition text). Leave all code cells untouched. Use the original's "Let's see if..." / "What's going on?" / "What if..." progression as the template, adapted to the restaurant scenario.

## User Constraints (from CONTEXT.md)

### Locked Decisions
#### Discovery arc placement
- Claude decides the specific "What if..." pattern: single pivotal moment (like the original), recurring pattern at transitions, or a blend -- whichever creates the strongest pedagogical arc
- Restore the original's "manual-first" feel for agent versions: emphasize "look how painful this is manually" before each automated version, so the frustration drives the discovery of why each version exists
- Claude evaluates which original elements to restore beyond framing (e.g., "What We Discovered" summaries, "To answer this..." walkthrough style) based on what strengthens the discovery arc

#### Narrative voice shift
- Mix approach: use conversational "let's try..." framing for discovery moments, keep clean prose for explanations and technical insights
- Rewrite the intro cell to hide the arc -- tease without spoiling (like the original's "Today we will code our way up to AI agents"), don't reveal "we discover what LLMs cannot do, what they can do..."
- Keep current visual style: blockquote Key Insights and output_box() calls (no emojis)
- Scope: Claude judges which cells need rework vs. which are fine as-is -- this is not a full rewrite, but more than just surgical insertions

#### Key Insight rework
- Claude decides which Key Insights should become discoveries vs. stay as clean conclusions -- big "aha" moments should feel earned, technical takeaways can be direct
- Claude decides whether to add "What We Discovered" summary moments and where, and whether to use output_box or markdown for them
- Current insight timing/placement is fine -- insights can appear before all evidence is fully explored

#### Spoiler management
- Rework Part headers to be neutral/curious rather than telegraphing conclusions: e.g., "Let's Test the LLM" instead of "What LLMs Can and Cannot Do"
- Agent version labels (v1: Keyword Matching, v2: LLM Understanding, etc.) stay as-is -- they help navigation without spoiling
- Make the ReAct naming a payoff moment: build up to the reveal rather than stating it flat -- "This loop we built -- Reason, Act, Observe, Repeat -- has a name in AI research: ReAct"

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact "What if..." pattern (single pivot, recurring, or blend)
- Which specific cells need rewriting vs. light touch vs. no change
- Whether to add "What We Discovered" summary cells and where
- Which original elements to restore beyond framing
- New Part header wording (must be neutral/curious, not declarative)
- Key Insight format decisions (discovery vs. conclusion per insight)

### Deferred Ideas (OUT OF SCOPE)
None -- discussion stayed within phase scope
</user_constraints>

## Standard Stack

This phase edits only markdown cells and a few output_box() code cells in an existing Jupyter notebook. No libraries, frameworks, or new code patterns are involved.

### Core
| Tool | Version | Purpose | Why Standard |
|------|---------|---------|--------------|
| Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) | N/A | Target artifact | Already exists, just editing cells |
| `output_box()` | N/A | Styled display boxes | Existing utility in `notebooks/utils/display.py` |
| `separator()` | N/A | Visual dividers | Existing utility |
| `llm_response()` | N/A | LLM output display | Existing utility |

### Available `output_box` Styles
| Style | Color | When to Use |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `"info"` | Blue | Neutral information boxes |
| `"success"` | Green | Positive outcomes, "What We Discovered" summaries |
| `"warning"` | Yellow | KEY INSIGHT boxes, important pedagogical moments |
| `"error"` | Red | Failure demonstrations, "this breaks" moments |

## Architecture Patterns

### Cell-by-Cell Audit: Current vs. Original Discovery Voice

The following audit maps every cell in the current notebook that needs attention. This is the primary artifact for the planner.

#### Cell 0 (markdown) -- Intro: FULL REWRITE needed

**Current (spoils the arc):**
> "Today we push further: we discover what LLMs *cannot* do, what they *can* do surprisingly well, and how combining those abilities creates something powerful -- an AI agent."

**Original (teases without spoiling):**
> "We will code our way up to AI Agents and to a definition of what an 'Agent' is"

**Problem:** The current intro reveals the entire narrative arc upfront -- that LLMs can't do things, that they can plan, and that this leads to agents. The original hid this journey.

**Recommendation:** Rewrite to tease the destination without revealing the path. Reference last week's learnings briefly, then say something like "Today we push further -- we'll code our way up to AI agents" without explaining the discovery arc.

---

#### Cell 2 (markdown) -- Part 1 header: REWRITE needed

**Current:** "## Part 1: What LLMs Can and Cannot Do" + "what happens when we need LLMs to DO things in the real world?"

**Problem:** The header "What LLMs Can and Cannot Do" tells students the conclusion before they discover it. The body text is also slightly declarative.

**Recommendation:** Change to something like "## Part 1: Let's Test the LLM" with body text framed as "Let's see what happens when we ask an LLM to do things beyond generating text."

---

#### Cell 4 (markdown) -- Post-math explanation: LIGHT TOUCH

**Current:** "The LLM attempted the math but may be wrong. It generates text that *looks like* math -- predicting plausible tokens -- but it never actually runs a multiplication algorithm."

**Problem:** This is a clean explanation but could benefit from the original's "What's going on?" curiosity framing before the explanation.

**Recommendation:** Add a discovery lead-in: "Interesting -- the LLM gave us a number, but is it right?" then the explanation. Or restructure to ask the question before answering it.

---

#### Cell 6 (markdown) -- Key Insight (LLMs can only generate text): REWORK to discovery

**Current:** Direct blockquote stating the conclusion.

**Problem:** This is the first major "aha" moment and should feel earned, not stated.

**Recommendation:** Convert from a clean conclusion to a discovered pattern. Frame as "Notice a pattern? In every case..." The blockquote format can stay, but the language should feel like we're noticing something together, not being told a fact.

---

#### Cell 7 (markdown) -- Part 2 header: REWRITE needed

**Current:** "## Part 2: But LLMs Can Plan" -- tells students what they'll discover.

**Problem:** "But LLMs Can Plan" is a spoiler. Students should discover this, not be told.

**Recommendation:** Something like "## Part 2: A Closer Look at Those Failures" or "## Part 2: Wait, Something Interesting Happened" -- draw attention to the planning ability they saw in Part 1 without naming it.

---

#### Cell 9 (code) -- KEY INSIGHT output_box: REWORK to pivot

**Current:** output_box with "KEY INSIGHT" label, warning style. States the "What if" idea directly.

**Problem:** This is THE pivotal moment of the notebook (the "What if...") and it's delivered as a labeled box. In the original, this was a markdown cell with "### THOUGHT: What if instead of asking LLMs to DO things, we ask them to tell us WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE?"

**Recommendation:** This should be the main "What if..." pivot moment. The output_box format can work, but the label should shift from "KEY INSIGHT" to something like "THE KEY QUESTION" or just use markdown with the "What if..." framing. This is one of the most important cells to get right -- it should feel like a genuine question, not a pre-packaged insight.

---

#### Cell 10 (markdown) -- Part 3 header: LIGHT TOUCH

**Current:** "## Part 3: From Text to Data (W2 Refresher)" + "Our scenario today: helping people find restaurants. We have some restaurant info, but it's buried in messy text..."

**Problem:** Minor -- the header is neutral enough, but could be slightly more discovery-oriented.

**Recommendation:** Header is acceptable as-is. Could add a brief "To answer this..." framing to the body text to connect it back to the "What if..." question from Part 2.

---

#### Cell 15 (markdown) -- Key Insight (structured extraction building block): NO CHANGE

**Current:** Clean blockquote explaining structured extraction as a building block.

**Problem:** None -- this is a technical takeaway, not a discovery moment. Fine as a direct conclusion.

---

#### Cell 16 (markdown) -- Part 4 header: LIGHT TOUCH

**Current:** "## Part 4: From Planning to Execution"

**Problem:** Slightly declarative but not badly spoiling. Could be more curious.

**Recommendation:** Something like "## Part 4: Can the LLM Actually Use a Tool?" or "## Part 4: From Ideas to Action" -- make it a question rather than a statement.

---

#### Cell 23 (markdown) -- Key Insight (LLM plans, system executes): REWORK to discovery

**Current:** Direct blockquote stating "The LLM never executed anything itself..."

**Problem:** This is the second major "aha" -- the core agent pattern. Should feel discovered.

**Recommendation:** Frame as discovery: "Did you notice what just happened? The LLM never actually ran anything..." Make the reader feel like they're noticing the pattern.

---

#### Cell 24 (code) -- "What We Discovered" box: LIGHT TOUCH

**Current:** output_box with "What We Discovered" label, success style, listing 4 steps.

**Problem:** This is good! It matches the original's "What We Discovered" pattern (original cell 23). The framing is earned because it comes after the demonstration.

**Recommendation:** Keep as-is or strengthen slightly. This is a good model for similar summary moments elsewhere.

---

#### Cell 25 (markdown) -- Part 5 header: LIGHT TOUCH

**Current:** "## Part 5: Restaurant Finder -- Building Our Scenario"

**Problem:** Neutral enough. The "Now let's build something real" lead-in is fine.

**Recommendation:** Could add a brief "To answer this, we need to..." framing (from the original) before the manual walkthroughs.

---

#### Cell 28 (code) -- Manual walkthrough simple: ADD discovery framing

**Current:** Has `separator("Manual Walkthrough: Simple Query")` but uses direct "Step 1:" format.

**Problem:** Missing the original's "To answer this, we need to:" framing that made students think alongside the instructor.

**Recommendation:** Add a brief intro line like "To answer this, we need to call one tool -- straightforward." before the steps. Keep it brief.

---

#### Cell 29 (code) -- Manual walkthrough complex: ADD frustration emphasis

**Current:** Ends with "That took 4 steps and a lot of manual work!" but the frustration could be stronger.

**Problem:** The original made manual work feel painful to motivate the automation. Current version notes it but doesn't dwell on it.

**Recommendation:** Strengthen the pain point. The final line could be more emphatic: "That took 4 steps, and we had to decide each step ourselves. Imagine doing this for every user question..." This directly motivates the agent versions.

---

#### Cell 31 (markdown) -- Part 6 header: LIGHT TOUCH

**Current:** "## Part 6: Building the Agent" + "Let's automate what we just did manually. We'll build 4 increasingly smart versions."

**Problem:** "We'll build 4 increasingly smart versions" reveals the structure. Better to let each version's limitation motivate the next.

**Recommendation:** Keep "## Part 6: Building the Agent" but change the body to something like "Let's see if we can automate those manual steps. Our first attempt will be simple..."

---

#### Cell 35 (markdown) -- Key Insight (keyword matching fragile): REWORK to discovery

**Current:** Direct blockquote about keyword matching being fragile.

**Problem:** This is a frustration-driven insight -- students should feel the frustration of broken keyword matching before the takeaway.

**Recommendation:** Frame as "See the problem? The agent only understood exact keywords..." Make it feel like noticing a flaw, not reading a textbook.

---

#### Cell 41 (markdown) -- Key Insight (multi-step limitation): NO CHANGE

**Current:** Clean blockquote explaining single-call limitation.

**Problem:** Minor -- could be slightly more discovery-oriented, but it's already well-placed after the failure demonstration.

**Recommendation:** Acceptable as-is. The failure demo in cell 40 already provides the discovery moment.

---

#### Cell 45 (markdown) -- Key Insight (need a loop) + v3 conclusion: LIGHT TOUCH

**Current:** Text explains v3's limitation, then blockquote about needing a loop.

**Problem:** The body text is good but slightly long. The Key Insight is well-framed.

**Recommendation:** Minor tightening. Ensure the frustration of "only ONE call" is emphasized before the loop insight.

---

#### Cell 46 (markdown) -- Part 7/v4 header: REWORK

**Current:** "### Agent v4: The Loop (ReAct)" -- reveals "ReAct" in the header before the student discovers it.

**Problem:** The user locked decision says "Make the ReAct naming a payoff moment." Using "ReAct" in the header spoils this.

**Recommendation:** Change to "### Agent v4: The Loop" -- remove "(ReAct)" from the header. The ReAct name gets revealed in Part 7 as a payoff.

---

#### Cell 49 (markdown) -- Key Insight (prompt grows): LIGHT TOUCH

**Current:** "Did you notice how the prompt grows with each step?"

**Problem:** Actually good! This is already framed as a discovery question. One of the cells that already has the right voice.

**Recommendation:** No change needed.

---

#### Cell 50 (markdown) -- Part 7 header (Agent Evolution): NO CHANGE

**Current:** Lists the 4-version evolution summary.

**Problem:** None -- this is a recap after the fact, not a spoiler.

---

#### Cell 51 (markdown) -- ReAct naming: REWORK for payoff

**Current:** "### The Pattern Has a Name" + "What we just built has a name: **ReAct** (Reasoning + Acting)."

**Problem:** This is stated flatly. Per user decision, the ReAct naming should be a payoff moment: "This loop we built -- Reason, Act, Observe, Repeat -- has a name in AI research: ReAct."

**Recommendation:** Build up to the reveal. Describe the loop pattern first (Reason -> Act -> Observe -> Repeat), THEN reveal "This pattern has a name in AI research: **ReAct**." Move the Anthropic definition into the same cell as supporting evidence, not a separate concept.

---

#### Cell 52 (code) -- KEY INSIGHT output_box (final): LIGHT TOUCH

**Current:** output_box with "KEY INSIGHT" label, warning style.

**Problem:** The content is good as a culminating summary. The label "KEY INSIGHT" is consistent.

**Recommendation:** Acceptable. Could be relabeled "What We Built" for a slightly more discovery-oriented feel, but "KEY INSIGHT" is also fine given the project convention.

---

#### Cell 53 (markdown) -- Part 8 (What's Next): NO CHANGE

**Current:** Bridge to Workshop 4.

**Problem:** None -- this is forward-looking, not needing discovery framing.

### Summary: Change Classification

| Category | Cell IDs | Count |
|----------|----------|-------|
| FULL REWRITE | 0, 2, 7 | 3 |
| REWORK | 6, 9, 23, 35, 46, 51 | 6 |
| LIGHT TOUCH | 4, 10, 16, 25, 28, 29, 31, 45, 52 | 9 |
| NO CHANGE | 15, 24, 41, 49, 50, 53, all code cells | ~35 |

Total cells needing edits: ~18 markdown/output_box cells
Total cells unchanged: ~35 (all code cells + some markdown)

### Pattern: Discovery Arc Design

**Recommended: Blend approach** (single major pivot + recurring micro-discoveries)

The notebook should have ONE central "What if..." pivot moment (the transition from Part 1 to Part 2, currently cell 9) plus several smaller discovery moments at key transitions:

```
Part 1: "Let's see if..." -> surprise/frustration -> "Notice the pattern?"
         (micro-discoveries: LLM fails at X, Y, Z)

Part 2: "Wait, something interesting..." -> "What if..." (MAIN PIVOT)
         (the big idea: ask LLMs to plan, not do)

Part 3-4: "To answer this, we need to..." -> demonstrate -> "Did you notice?"
         (micro-discoveries: LLM plans, system executes)

Part 5: "Imagine doing this manually..." -> frustration -> "Let's automate"
         (pain-driven motivation)

Part 6: "Our first attempt..." -> breaks -> "What if we used LLM?" -> still breaks -> "What if it looped?"
         (escalating frustration drives each version)

Part 7: "This loop we built has a name..." -> PAYOFF (ReAct reveal)
```

### Pattern: Voice Mixing

| Context | Voice | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Discovery moments | Conversational | "Let's see if...", "What's going on?", "Notice something?" |
| Explanations | Clean prose | "The LLM generates text that looks like math but never runs a multiplication algorithm." |
| Key Insights (discovery) | Discovery question + answer | "Did you notice? The LLM never actually ran anything..." |
| Key Insights (technical) | Direct statement | "This is the same structured extraction from last week..." |
| "What We Discovered" | Earned summary | Numbered list in output_box, success style |

### Pattern: Elements to Restore from Original

Based on analysis of the original (commit 4ef0ef5), these elements strengthen the discovery arc:

1. **"Let's see if..." framing** (original cell 5): Used before testing LLM capabilities. Restoring this creates anticipation.

2. **"What's going on?" moment** (original cell 7): Used after LLM fails at math. Creates a pause for reflection before explanation.

3. **"What if..." pivot** (original cell 18): THE central insight. Currently exists as an output_box in cell 9, needs to feel more like a genuine question.

4. **"What We Discovered" summary** (original cell 23): Already present in current cell 24. Consider adding one more at the end of Part 7 (after ReAct reveal) to summarize the full journey.

5. **"To answer this, we need to:" walkthrough style** (original cell 35+): Used before manual walkthroughs. Not currently in the notebook -- should be added to cells 28-29 intros.

Elements NOT to restore:
- Emojis (original used them extensively; current style is no-emoji)
- `pandas` import (original used it; current notebook doesn't need it)
- ER Hospital scenario (replaced by restaurants -- out of scope)
- Section dividers via `<hr>` (current uses `separator()` utility instead)

## Don't Hand-Roll

| Problem | Don't Build | Use Instead | Why |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Styled output boxes | Custom HTML in markdown cells | `output_box()` with appropriate style param | Consistent visual style across all notebooks |
| Section dividers | Raw `<hr>` or `---` | `separator()` utility | Consistent visual style |
| LLM output display | Plain `print()` | `llm_response()` | Consistent visual style |

**Key insight:** This phase edits narrative text, not code. The "don't hand-roll" constraint is about maintaining visual consistency with the existing display utility pattern.

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Over-rewriting (Scope Creep)
**What goes wrong:** Editing "just the framing" expands into rewriting explanations, restructuring code cells, or adding new content.
**Why it happens:** Once you start reading cells with fresh eyes, every imperfection looks fixable.
**How to avoid:** Strict cell-by-cell classification (FULL REWRITE / REWORK / LIGHT TOUCH / NO CHANGE). Code cells are NEVER touched. If a code cell's output already demonstrates the discovery, the markdown around it is sufficient.
**Warning signs:** Editing code cells, adding new code functionality, creating new Parts.

### Pitfall 2: Making "What if..." Feel Forced
**What goes wrong:** Inserting "What if..." questions that don't flow naturally from the preceding content.
**Why it happens:** Trying to match the original's pattern without understanding why each question worked in context.
**How to avoid:** Each "What if..." or discovery question must arise from something the student just saw. The question should feel inevitable, not inserted.
**Warning signs:** Questions that don't reference the preceding cell's content, generic curiosity prompts.

### Pitfall 3: Spoiler Overcompensation
**What goes wrong:** Making Part headers so vague that students can't navigate the notebook or find their place.
**Why it happens:** Trying to avoid ALL information in headers.
**How to avoid:** Headers should be neutral/curious, not empty. "Let's Test the LLM" gives enough navigation context without spoiling. Agent version labels stay as-is per user decision.
**Warning signs:** Headers like "Part 2" with no descriptive text, students unable to find specific sections.

### Pitfall 4: Inconsistent Voice
**What goes wrong:** Some cells use conversational discovery voice, others remain declarative, creating tonal whiplash.
**Why it happens:** Selective editing -- rewriting some cells but skipping adjacent ones.
**How to avoid:** After all edits, read the notebook sequentially to check voice consistency. The mix approach (conversational for discovery, clean prose for explanations) should feel intentional, not accidental.
**Warning signs:** Adjacent cells with drastically different tones.

### Pitfall 5: Breaking Notebook Cell Structure
**What goes wrong:** Changing cell IDs, reordering cells, or splitting/merging cells in a way that breaks the notebook.
**Why it happens:** Jupyter notebook JSON is fragile -- cell IDs must be preserved for existing references.
**How to avoid:** Edit cell content only, never restructure. If a new cell is needed (e.g., adding a "What We Discovered" summary), insert it cleanly. Never delete existing cells.
**Warning signs:** Changed cell ordering, missing cells, broken execution flow.

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Discovery-framed Key Insight (blockquote)
```markdown
> **Key Insight:** Did you notice the pattern? In every case -- math, time, files, weather -- the LLM produced text that *looks like* an answer but never actually performed the action. LLMs can only generate text. They cannot perform calculations, access files, check the time, or fetch live data.
```
vs. current declarative version:
```markdown
> **Key Insight:** LLMs can only generate text. They cannot perform calculations, access files, check the time, or fetch live data. Everything they produce is a prediction of what text should come next.
```

### Example 2: Part header (neutral/curious)
```markdown
## Part 1: Let's Test the LLM

Last week we learned how LLMs work and how to guide them with prompts. Today let's push further -- what happens when we ask an LLM to do something beyond generating text?
```
vs. current declarative version:
```markdown
## Part 1: What LLMs Can and Cannot Do

Last week we learned how LLMs work -- predicting the next token -- and how to guide them with prompts and structured extraction. Today we'll push further: what happens when we need LLMs to DO things in the real world?
```

### Example 3: "What if..." pivot (output_box)
```python
output_box(
    "What if instead of asking LLMs to DO things, we ask them to "
    "PLAN what needs to be done -- and then a system executes the plan?",
    label="THE KEY QUESTION",
    style="warning"
)
```

### Example 4: ReAct payoff reveal
```markdown
### The Pattern Has a Name

Think about what our v4 agent does each step:
1. **Reason** about what information it needs
2. **Act** by calling a tool
3. **Observe** the result
4. **Repeat** until the question is answered

This loop we built -- Reason, Act, Observe, Repeat -- has a name in AI research: **ReAct** (Reasoning + Acting).

Anthropic defines an agent as: *"A system that uses an LLM to decide what actions to take and in what order."* That's exactly what our v4 agent does.
```

### Example 5: "What We Discovered" summary (output_box)
```python
output_box(
    "1. LLMs can only generate text -- they cannot perform actions\n"
    "2. But LLMs are excellent at planning what needs to be done\n"
    "3. If we let the LLM plan and a system execute, we get correct results\n"
    "4. This pattern -- LLM plans, system executes -- is the foundation of agents",
    label="What We Discovered",
    style="success"
)
```

### Example 6: Manual walkthrough with "To answer this..." framing
```python
separator("Manual Walkthrough: Complex Query")
print("Question: What's the cheapest restaurant within 10 minutes?")
print()
print("To answer this, we need to:")
print("  1. Get the list of all restaurants")
print("  2. Check the distance to each one")
print("  3. Calculate travel times and filter by 10 minutes")
print("  4. Compare prices of the nearby ones")
print()
print("That's a lot of steps. Let's work through it...")
```

## State of the Art

Not applicable -- this phase is about pedagogical narrative design, not technology choices.

## Open Questions

1. **How many "What We Discovered" summary cells to add?**
   - What we know: Cell 24 already has one (after Part 4). The original had one (cell 23).
   - What's unclear: Whether to add a second one at the end of Part 7 (after ReAct reveal) to summarize the full journey.
   - Recommendation: Add one after Part 7 as a capstone summary. Two total "What We Discovered" moments provides good rhythm without overdoing it.

2. **Should the v4 header mention "ReAct" at all?**
   - What we know: User decision says ReAct naming should be a payoff moment. Current cell 46 says "### Agent v4: The Loop (ReAct)".
   - What's unclear: Whether removing "(ReAct)" from the v4 header makes it hard to navigate back to v4 when reviewing.
   - Recommendation: Remove "(ReAct)" from the v4 header. The Part 7 reveal cell immediately follows and provides the name. For navigation, "Agent v4: The Loop" is sufficiently descriptive.

3. **Exact intro cell wording**
   - What we know: Must tease without spoiling. Original said "we will code our way up to AI Agents."
   - What's unclear: How much of last week's recap to include.
   - Recommendation: Keep the recap brief (1 sentence). Focus on the tease: "Today we push further -- we'll code our way up to AI agents and discover what makes them work."
