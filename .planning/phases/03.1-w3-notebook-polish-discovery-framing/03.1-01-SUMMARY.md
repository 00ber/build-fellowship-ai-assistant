# Phase 03.1 Plan 01: Discovery Framing Summary

**Rewrote 18 notebook cells to restore discovery-driven pedagogical arc -- intro teases without spoiling, Part headers use curious language, Key Insights feel earned through discovery questions, and ReAct naming is a build-up-then-reveal payoff moment**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-24T14:39:33Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-24T14:42:27Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Parts 1-4 reframed: intro hides discovery arc, Part headers are neutral/curious, Key Insights use "Did you notice..." framing, "What if..." pivot labeled THE KEY QUESTION
- Parts 5-8 reframed: manual walkthroughs emphasize pain, Part 6 does not reveal agent version count, v4 header drops "ReAct", ReAct naming builds Reason/Act/Observe/Repeat BEFORE revealing the name
- Full notebook reads with consistent discovery voice from start to finish with no tonal whiplash

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Rewrite discovery arc for Parts 1-4** - `f5c2ada` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Rewrite discovery arc for Parts 5-8** - `d3a27c7` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `notebooks/workshop_03_building_ai_agents_foundations.ipynb` - Workshop 3 notebook with discovery-driven framing in 18 cells (cells 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 16, 23, 25, 28, 29, 31, 35, 45, 46, 51, 52)

## Decisions Made
- Blend approach for discovery arc: single major "What if..." pivot (cell 9) plus recurring micro-discoveries at transitions
- ReAct naming withheld from v4 header (cell 46), revealed as payoff in cell 51 after listing Reason/Act/Observe/Repeat steps
- Final output_box (cell 52) relabeled from "KEY INSIGHT" to "What We Built" for discovery feel
- Cell 45 Key Insight kept mostly as-is since it already had good discovery voice

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Workshop 3 notebook has consistent discovery-driven voice throughout
- Ready for any future polish phases or Workshop 4 materials development
- The discovery framing pattern (conversational lead-ins, discovery questions for aha moments, build-up-then-reveal for named patterns) is established for use in future workshop notebooks

## Self-Check: PASSED

- FOUND: notebooks/workshop_03_building_ai_agents_foundations.ipynb
- FOUND: f5c2ada (Task 1 commit)
- FOUND: d3a27c7 (Task 2 commit)
